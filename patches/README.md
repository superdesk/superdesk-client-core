# immutable+3.8.2.patch

Fixes types in immutable so values in predicate callback are not received as optional. It's likely this is already fixed in newer versions of immutable.

# @types+draft-js++immutable+3.7.6.patch

Same immutable patch, but applies also to immutable types located inside draft-js

# csstype+2.6.17

Removing some CSS properties from types like `paddingLeft`, `borderLeft` etc. to enforce RTL support.
